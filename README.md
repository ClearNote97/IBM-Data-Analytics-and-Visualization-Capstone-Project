# IBM-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Capstone-Project
## Overview
This data science project aims to explore the future perspectives of programming languages and database management systems (DBMS) usage. By analyzing data from various sources, we aim to uncover insights into the evolving trends and potential mismatches between enterprise demands and programmer preferences in programming languages. Additionally, we'll examine the transition towards Free to Use software in DBMS and provide guidance for programmers to select high cost/efficiency specialized programming languages, where experience is a valuable asset in the IT industry.

## Methodology
### Data Collection:
A subset of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 was obtained using a Flask API.
Programming Languages Annual Salary data was web scrapped.

### Data Processing and Exploration:
Data was processed to remove duplicates and impute missing values.
Characteristics of respondents were determined.
Interest variables' distribution, correlations, and outliers were analyzed.

### Data Visualization:
The most important variables were transformed into visuals using Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE) to present a comprehensive story of the insights.
This repository serves as a comprehensive data science analysis, showcasing the entire process from data gathering through web scraping to insightful visualizations using Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE). The findings can provide valuable guidance for programmers and enterprises in making informed decisions regarding programming languages and DBMS usage.
